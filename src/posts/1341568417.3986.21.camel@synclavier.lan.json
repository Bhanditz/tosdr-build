  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nYesterday, Michel and I had a chat with Peter and Dan from Tosback2. We\nthought it would be a good idea to introduce ourselves here as well. I\nam currently working on a project to rate Terms of Service:\n        http://www.tos-dr.info \n        tosdr@googlegroups.com is our mailing-list (don't hesitate to\n        join, we need more people to discuss legal issues, especially\n        from the US; and more opinions and dialogue)\n        \nOur goal is to stop the biggest lie on the Web, no less! :) I am\nreferring of course to \"I have read and agree to the Terms of Service\"\nso we want to raise awareness so that people understand what they sign\nup for e.g. when they use Facebook or Twitter.\n\nOf course, we're doing it the free software way. The website is under\nAGPL-3.0 and our raw data (json files) CCBySA-3.0 and we're looking to\nwork on top of tosback2 and other groups (you might also be interested\nin giving a look at tossos.com) \n\n\n\nNow maybe let me get more specific. For ToS;DR we needed to create\nobjects for each service with some data, e.g. with Facebook:\nhttps://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/blob/master/services/facebook.json\n\n        {\n          \"id\": \"facebook\",\n          \"service\": \"Facebook\",\n          \"url\": \"https://www.facebook.com\",\n          \"rated\": false,\n          \"tos\": {\n            \"terms\": \"https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms\",\n            \"privacy\": \"https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy\"\n          },\n          \"related\": [\n            \"diaspora\"\n          ],\n          \"last-diff\": \"https://www.tosback.org/diff.php?vid=1740\",\n          \"last-archive\": \"\", \n          \"date\": \"2011-07-07\",\n          \"clause\": [\n            \"kizrN7qb1Ck\",\n            \"kizrN7qb1Ck2\",\n            \"VTlWfubfib4\",\n            \"eff-back-in-congress\",\n            \"eff-back-tell-user-no\",\n            \"eff-back-transparency-data-50\"\n          ]\n        }\n        \n^^^ a lot of this stuff is not finished, it was just written there as a\ndraft: for instance the last-diff thing , etc. All this will probably be\nwritten in more details to be conform with tosback2.\n        \nSome of this information might be redundant with what tosback2's already\ndoing. Especially, it has always been our goal to integrate with\ntosback2 -- so now that I have more information, we need to find a way\nto build upon something like tosback2's facebook xml files:\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook.com.xml (the most recent file)\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Terms_of_Use.xml\n      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Privacy_Policy.xml\n\nSo my question is: how is Tosback2 supposed to make use of several\ndocuments for the same service? The case of Facebook is very common as\nmany services maintain separate documents for ToS and PP. (I want to\nmake a git pull request to give twitpic's ToS for instance, as so far\ntosback2-data only has the PP)\n\nThe other point is that we started to maintain different objects for\nservice id and service url. So I wonder about the choice to maintain a\nxml filename different from <sitename> (in the two older files) or if\nthis is deprecated. If this is deprecated and that sitename (which is\nbasically the service's url) and the service xml file should be the\nsame: what's the reason for this?\n\nFor instance, what about services using the same Terms but which can be\nfederated and accessed through different means, etc.? How can you group\nwebsites with the same policies?\n\nThat was one of the main concern from my side for choosing to\ndifferentiate a service's id with a service's url.\n\nOne last thing: I'm using pagekite to make my localhost available to the\nworld, so if I am connected, you can check the current development\nversion at http://synclavier.hugo.pagekite.me\n\nBest,\n\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
