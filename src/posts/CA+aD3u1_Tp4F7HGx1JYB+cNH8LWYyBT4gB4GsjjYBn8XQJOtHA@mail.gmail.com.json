  "text": "For reference, this is what Jan and I talked about in December. I\nstill think the 'location of court of law' one is not something you\ncan call globally good or bad about a service - but maybe we can add\n'a large percentage of users will be able to use the service under the\nlaw system of the country where they (habitually) live'? i guess all\nlaw systems have good and bad aspects, but i know a lot of Europeans\ntrust their own country's law system, or that of other European\ncountries, more than the US law system. that's the reason this point\nis on there. but it's a difficult one to implement, i guess.\n\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Jan-Christoph Borchardt <jan@unhosted.org>\nDate: Thu, Dec 29, 2011 at 10:38 AM\nSubject: Re: criteria to (not) add\nTo: Michiel de Jong <michiel@unhosted.org>\n\n\nMy thoughts on criteria (maybe merging):\n\n1) (basically revised this one, data liberation has enough weight)\nOwnership & Data liberation (not sure, but data liberation as it is\nhas not enough weight on its own)\n2) Equality & Anonymity (because the case for separating it is\nspecifically Dropbox – rephrase to »service is blind to location, real\nname, …« – »political views« are also problematic because that’s not a\nmatter of freedom of speech (see Swastika in Germany))\n3) Third Parties (advertising) & Law enforcement (both essentially\n»giving stuff away to third parties«)\n4) Location of court of law (not sure, maybe merge with EEA?)\n\nThe 2 new ones:\n1) this service is exploited by a for-profit company / is not ...\n2) there is a contact person for questions and complaints about this\nservice / there is none\ndon’t warrant 2 whole new criteria in my eyes. Especially the\nfor-/non-profit one. Maybe if we rephrase or merge, but just binary\n»non-profit« or »for-profit« is too short sighted. Giving data away to\nadvertisers for instance would be exclusive to for-profits, wouldn’t\nit?\n\nAlso a bit of devil’s advocate – on the discussion page we should also\nsay why we included the criteria and why in this form.\n\nJust to mention it, another approach from the »big but few criteria«\nwould be »many but just binary criteria«. That would leave us with,\nsay, 50 criteria though (30 at least) and would be very non-accurate\n(say, data liberation would not be expressed with a simple binary\nchoice as it doesn’t account for open formats, usability between\nservices, importing etc. – and if it does, it would be a very\nblack/white choice.)\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Dec 29, 2011 at 10:20 AM, Michiel de Jong <michiel@unhosted.org> wrote:\n> add:\n>\n> this service is exploited by a for-profit company / is not ...\n>\n> there is a contact person for questions and complaints about this service /\n> there is none\n>\n> remove:\n> the court of law is in an oppressive regime\n>\n> don't add:\n> your data stays in the EEA (only relevant for Europeans)\n> accessilbility (more general ethics than actual ToS)\n> standards compliance (same reason)\n> green power (same reason)\n>\n",
