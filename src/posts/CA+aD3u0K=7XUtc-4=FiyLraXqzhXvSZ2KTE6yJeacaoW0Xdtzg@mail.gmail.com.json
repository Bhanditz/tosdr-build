This is where it\ngets serious, because:\n\n    If we succeed, then Google will award matching funding through the\nGruender Garage competition, in which our campaign is nominated:\n\n    http://www.indiegogo.com/partners/ggde\n\nAlso, for those of you who listen to the 'On The Media' radio show in\nthe USA, Bob Garfield will be talking about our campaign probably\neither today or next week, so that should hopefully give us some\ntraffic as well.\n\nSo please keep telling all your friends about our crowdfunding\ncampaign! :) If we make it to 100%, then with your help, we will\nreally be able to get this project off the ground. Our campaign is\nhere:\n\n    http://www.indiegogo.com/terms-of-service-didnt-read\n\n\nCheers!\nMichiel\n",
