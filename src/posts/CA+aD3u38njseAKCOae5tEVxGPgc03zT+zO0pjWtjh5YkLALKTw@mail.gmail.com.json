  "text": "There's a campaign called WirSpeichernNicht.de, which aims to convince\nwebsites to not keep identifiable data in webserver logs. i think\nlogging should be switched off by default (that's better for\nperformance anyway), and only be used to mitigate DoS attacks and\nsuch.\n\nThe use of webserver logs to determine demographics of a website's\nvisitors is, i guess, *only* acceptable if data is anonymized before\nit is stored. And anonymizing is not very easy technically, so should\nbe done with some care, and by people who know what they're doing,\nbefore any logs are published to marketing departments or third\nparties etcetera.\n\nright now, the default is that you're being tracked all the time, and\nthis creates a slippery slope. if we promote privacy by default, then\nusers can still opt-in to be counted in tracking experiments. this\nalso relates to the DoNotTrack header, i guess?\n\njust had a discussion with Hugo and Erkan about this, Hugo in\nparticular doesn't at all agree with me that this is a consumer's\nright we should be defending... curious how important other people\nfind this topic!\n\nCheers,\nMichiel\n",
