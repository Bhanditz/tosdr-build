  "text": "I was just talking to Kirsten from HIIG about how there are some\ninteresting questions re ToS and freedom of speech. for instance,\n\nTwitter\n=====\n- prohibits publishing content that:\n  - impersonates others or is intended to mislead\n  - is other people's confidential or private information\n  - contains a threat of violence\n  - is copyrighted\n  - is aimed at furthering illegal activities\n  - is spam\n\n- they don't seem to talk about racism and other hatefully provocative\ncontent, nor about nudity or culturally offensive content.\n\nhttps://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules#\n\nFacebook\n=======\n- prohibits publishing:\n  - violence and threats\n  - self harm\n  - bullying and harrassment\n  - hate speech\n  - graphic content\n  - nudity and pornography\n  - identity and privacy (way down the list, compared to where twitter puts it)\n  - intellectual property\n  - phishing and spam\n\n- compared to twitter, no explicit mention of content that is aimed at\nfurthering illegal activities\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/communitystandards\n\nGoogle+\n=======\n- the mention:\n  - illicit content\n  - malicious products\n  - hate speech\n  - personal and confidential information\n  - account hijacking\n  - child safety\n  - spam\n  - ranking manipulation\n  - sexually explicit material\n  - violent or bullying behaviour\n  - impersonation or deceptive behaviour\n  - they don't allow you to use a pseudonym\n  - don't sell regulated goods (viagra etc.)\n\nhttp://www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/content.html\n\nSo putting these three into a table, we see:\n\n(T,F,G) violence and threats\n(F) self harm\n(F,G) bullying and harrassment\n(F,G) hate speech\n(F) graphic content\n(F,G) nudity and pornography\n(T,F,G) impersonation/misleading\n(T,F,G) privacy of others\n(T,F) intellectual property\n(T,F,G) phishing and spam\n(T) is aimed at furthering illegal activities\n(G) illicit content\n(G) malicious products\n(G) child safety\n(G) ranking manipulation\n(G) they don't allow you to use a pseudonym\n(G) don't sell regulated goods (viagra etc.)\n\nThis is just a quick first look at how different services restrict\nyour freedom of speech. most of them seem to be aimed at reasonable\nreason, protecting the rights of others that often weigh against your\nfreedom of speech. But let's continue this discussion! :)\n\nCiao,\nMichiel\n",
