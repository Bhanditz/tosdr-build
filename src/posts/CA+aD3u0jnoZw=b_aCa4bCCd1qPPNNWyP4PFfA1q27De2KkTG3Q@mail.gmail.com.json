  "text": "Thank you Sebasti√°n Waisbrot and Steve Kroon for your posts about\nRapidshare, Nabble, Informe and Freeforums last Friday! I have\nimported them with a provisionally assigned weight of 50 out of 100.\nThey now show up on our staging server\nhttp://unhosted.github.com/ToS-DR/ and should go onto the live site\nsoon. We still need to compare which weights we have given to\nequivalent point for other services to see what weight each point\nshould get, double check that everything is correct, and also add the\ncorrect logos still.\n\nThanks a lot for your reviews, I'll try to free up some time so we can\nbe more responsive in transferring data points from the mailing list\nto the website.\n\nWe are also launching our crowd funding campaign this week by the way,\nso everybody who believes in this project, please have your wallets\nready! :)\n\n\nCiao,\nMichiel\n",
