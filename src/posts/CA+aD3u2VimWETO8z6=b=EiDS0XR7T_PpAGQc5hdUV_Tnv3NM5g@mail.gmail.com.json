  "text": "when you install packaged apps from a web app store into a browser,\nit's a bit like installing an app on a phone. Apple is already only\nallowing only Apple App Store apps onto iOS devices, but i think (i\nhaven't actually tried this) Google is allowing alternatives to\nAndroid Market on Android. Also, if you run Microsoft Windows on your\ncomputer, then you can install any software you like, wherever it\ncomes from. You don't need permission from Microsoft to install\nsoftware you choose on your device.\n\nThat's why iOS can be called a 'closed platform' while Android and\nWindows are 'open platforms'. Anyway, for their Chrome platform was\nalways open until about a month ago, and then they seem to have gone\nwith the 'closed platform'.\n\nin theory, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft could (in\nthe future) offer packaged web app stores to their customers, and it\nwould be nice if they would be compatible with the Chrome browser,\nwith the Chrome OS operating system, and with the Chromebook device.\nAnd they used to be, but now they're not anymore.\n\nIronically, their statement\nhttp://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/?p=crx_warning  about this\nchange says:\n\n\"The updated installation process [...] gives you more control over\nthe extensions you're adding to Chrome.\"\n\ni think what they meant to say was 'gives *us* more control' :)\n\ni asked Google about this but they didn't really reply (yet); see this\nthread on the chrome web store forum\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-apps/AZcMm413xww\nfor the discussion. enterprise customers are apparently not affected,\nonly direct end users, and there is a work-around (download the app to\na file, then drag-and-drop the file to Chrome's extensions tab) but\nthat's cumbersome.\n\n\nciao,\nMichiel\n",
