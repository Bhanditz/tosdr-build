  "text": "i just got prompted by facebook (during normal use) to 'read these\nsecurity tips' http://www.facebook.com/about/security?mp=2\n\nI've seen several other websites do this (airbnb, wg-gesucht, tuenti,\ning bank, gmail), and for some services it's more relevant than for\nothers, but i think it's important from a consumer rights point of\nview that a service takes reasonable efforts to make the service safer\nto use for consumers.\n\neven if the service is aimed at tech savvy users, it should at the\nvery least warn people when they choose a weak password (the little\nstrength meter), and if there is valuable data, two-factor passwords,\nhttps, and other security measures should be a consumer right i think.\n\nif a service puts users at risk of oversharing (no, i won't shut up\nabout it ;) or scams, i would say it is the duty of the service to\nwarn about this.\n\nof course more \"be safer online\" education is needed if a service is\naimed at non-technical people and especially minors.\n\nso i think facebook did not do this very well in the past, but is\ndoing a good job at it now.\n",
