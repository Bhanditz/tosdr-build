  "text": "Hello,\n\nI just wanted to give all of you some heads-up about the project. As you\nmay have seen on tos-dr.info we now have 2 browser extensions (Chrome\nand Firefox) and we just released a first draft of a lightweight API,\nsee http://tos-dr.info/api.html\n\n= Branding = \n\nAt the beginning, ToS;DR was meant more as a codename than as a real\nname for the general public. But it seems that the media has picked it\nup just fine and most of the articles explained nicely where it came\nfrom (Internet's TL;DR). But we are still not sure whether we could\nimprove this or not. One thing we could do is find a better domain name,\neven if we don't change the name of the project itself. Something like\nreadtheterms.org Do you have suggestions criticisms about that?\n\n= Sustainability: Donations and hiring =\n\nWe are going to launch a funding campaign, most probably crowd-funding\nso that we can hire a full-time person to make sure no points get lost\nand that all discussions can go to a concrete point on the website. This\nperson will work with Michiel and I will continue contributing as a\nvolunteer (as I have to get back to law studies in September).\n\nIdeally,  a contributor with legal background would be ideal. If you'd\nlike to work full-time on this project, don't hesitate to contact us.\n\nThere have been a lot of discussion recently, so I hope in the next days\nthat we can have some of the data onto the website :)\n\nThank you all for your contributions,\nBest regards\n\nHugo\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
