  "text": "To continue on the thread about copyright licenses\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tosdr/kizrN7qb1Ck\n(please answer to that post if you have further opinion about the\ngeneral topic)\n\nLet's now focus on Twitter terms. https://twitter.com/tos\n\nTL;DR: \n     1. [mediocre] Ownership: The copyright license is very broad and\n        goes beyond the requirements to run the service,\n     2. [mediocre] Third-parties: Your data can be shared with Twitter's\n        partners and other third-parties, on Twitter's terms – not\n        yours.\n\nThe copyright license in Twitter terms is, as I wrote earlier, very\nbroad:\n        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or\n        display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or\n        displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a\n        worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right\n        to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify,\n        publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any\n        and all media or distribution methods (now known or later\n        developed).\n        \n        [Tip This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets\n        available to the rest of the world and to let others do the\n        same.]\n        \nThat seems reasonable, but is it? The \"Tip\" is very optimistic. The\nlicense isn't just about the rights \"to display to the world\" but is\nindeed much larger.\n\nI would say that the most worrying aspect of this license is that there\nare absolutely no limitations to this license. By limitations, I mean\nsomething like SeenThis (Twitter competitor) \"autorisations permettant\nle bon fonctionnement du système\" or Dropbox's \"These Terms do not grant\nus any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the\nlimited rights that are needed to run the Services\". Dropbox also\ndocuments in their privacy policy why exactly and with whom information\nis shared.\n\nMoreover if you look at how Twitter handled copyright prior to their\nSeptember 2009 changes, you get a very different picture. Here's what we\nhad before:\n        Copyright (What’s Yours is Yours)\n        \n            We claim no intellectual property rights over the material\n        you provide to the Twitter service. Your profile and materials\n        uploaded remain yours. [...]\n            We encourage users to contribute their creations to the\n        public domain or consider progressive licensing terms.\n        \nI believe it's possible that this former policy may encounter problems.\nHowever I am not convinced that the current solution is in the best\ninterest of the users. With such a broad scope in the copyright license,\nTwitter effectively becomes owner of the data (tweet, meta information\nin the tweet, pictures tweeted; etc.) and can transfer or sublicense to\nthird parties. As acknowledges the current TOS:\n        \n        You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to\n        provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content\n        submitted to or through the Services available to other\n        companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter\n        for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of\n        such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms\n        and conditions for such Content use.\n        \n        [Tip Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem\n        partners can interact with your Content. These rules exist to\n        enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what’s\n        yours is yours – you own your Content (and your photos are part\n        of that Content).]\n\nTo me, what's in the best interest of the user is a copyright license\nchosen by the user, like for instance CC-BY or CC-BY-SA or CC-BY-NC or\nCC-BY-ND, whatever the _user_ chooses. At least in these case it is\nclear for users how their content is licensed.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
