  "text": "As you know, Google has decided to unify their ToS and privacy policy\nunder one umbrella rather than maintaining specific ToS for each of\ntheir service.\n\nThis is both a good and a bad thing. The good thing is that this makes\nthings simpler to understand. The downside: you don't really know to\nwhat service you agree :^) and your data for, say, a photo sharing\napplication, could be re-used later in another Google service that\ndidn't exist before.\n\nThis is reflected in the copyright license. Overall, this copyright\nlicense seems reasonable enough compared to Facebook or Twitter for\ninstance, as it is limited. However this limitation goes beyond the\nrequirement for running the service, as it includes \"promoting\" the\nservice. But that seems okay to me. As pointed out earlier, the problem\nlies in what constitutes \"the service\" itself because it is basically\nany Google service, existing or not-yet-existing.\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/\n        When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you\n        give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use,\n        host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as\n        those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes\n        we make so that your content works better with our Services),\n        communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and\n        distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license\n        *are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and\n        improving our Services, and to develop new ones*. This license\n        continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for\n        a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services\n        may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been\n        provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there\n        are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the\n        content submitted in those Services.\n        \n\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
