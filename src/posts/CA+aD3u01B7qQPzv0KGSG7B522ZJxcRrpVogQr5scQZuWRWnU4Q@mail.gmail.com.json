  "text": "We just launched the crowdfunding campaign for this project:\nhttp://www.indiegogo.com/terms-of-service-didnt-read\n\nThis mailing list will always be based on voluntary and open\ndiscussion, but there is quite a lot of 'curator' work to do as well -\nwe need to codify all discussion threads into well classified data\npoints, compare them to similar topics to calibrate the weight\ndifferent data points have and to make sure we make an objective\nassessment of each one.\n\nWe also need to stay up to date with changing Term of Service of\nservices which we already rated. We cannot rely on the mailing list to\nalways bring up the discussions that need discussing - we need to have\na reliable full-time base team who pro-actively bring up points that\nneed to be updated.\n\nAnd we need to develop tools, try to integrate with other projects\nwhere beneficial, reach out to the press where it can help awareness,\netcetera.\n\nIn short, we need at least one full-time person to run this project.\nAt the same time, we want this to be a non-profit and unaffiliated\nproject, because objectivity is such an important part of it. This\nmeans we rely on donations to run this project.\n\nBy signing up for this mailing list, you have counted yourself in our\nmost valuable inner circle! If you cannot afford a big donation, don't\nworry: we would be honoured with even just the basic 5 euro one, so\nthat on our list of donators, we can proudly list the people who care\nmost about this project, namely you.\n\nAlso, you can help us a lot throughout the next 24 days, by\nperiodically making as much noise as you can about how you see the\nimportance of the Terms of Service; Didn't Read project. If you could\nspare us one or two tweets a week, that would really improve this\nproject's chances of success.\n\nWe set 10,000 euros as the campaign goal, which should get us well\ninto 2013. I think we can make it. We had a lot of help from the press\nso far, but now is the moment of truth.\n\nThe coming 24 days are our one big chance to Launch This Rocket. Are\nyou with us?\n\n\nYours sincerely,\nHugo, Jan & Michiel.\n",
