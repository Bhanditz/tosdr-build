  "text": "that's weird. fair enough that 'couchsurfing' may be a trademark, but\nhow can a website prohibit other websites to link to it? that breaks\nthe architecture of the web.\n\n\"You are granted a limited, non-exclusive right to create a text\nhyperlink to the Services, provided such link does not portray\nCouchSurfing or any of our services in a false, misleading, derogatory\nor otherwise defamatory manner and provided further that the linking\nsite does not contain any adult or illegal material or any material\nthat is offensive, harassing or otherwise objectionable. This limited\nright may be revoked at any time.\"\n\nIs their website's URL so precious that it shall go unspoken? I\nunderstand they have a right not to be spoken about in a hateful or\nmisleading way (that should be covered by libel, hate speak and\nsimilar law, right?), but i don't think they can forbid other people\nto speak about them just because they say in their terms that they may\nrevoke the right to link to them at any time. i wonder why this clause\nis there?\n",
