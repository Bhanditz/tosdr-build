The code is\nquite hacky but what it does is recursively fetch the list of services\nand of data points using XHR. Apparently this is simply not happening\nif you open the site in Internet Explorer. If someone can check why\nthis might be then that would be awesome! the code is on\nhttps://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR\n\nciao,\nMichiel\n",
