Also it's a good opinion to use when\nassigning weights.\n\nAnd on a side note - as suggested by\nhttp://www.switchfast.com/switchfast-blog/2012/8/30/how-to-assess-a-terms-of-service-agreement-without-really-trying.aspx\nonce we have worked through our backlog, we could probably\ndouble-check all sites for these 7 points (as well as for each topic\non http://tos-dr.info/topics.html ) before we assign a class to them,\nso we don't leave any questions unanswered. Just to make sure\neverything is there, all our reviews our thorough.\n\n\nCheers,\nMichiel\n",
