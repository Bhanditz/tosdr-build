  "text": "It is quite impressive how much information you can find in plain text\non facebook pages, if you know where to look.  Maybe I should just map\nthe facebook maze^W website.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=186325668085084#What-information-does-Facebook-get-about-me-when-I-visit-a-website-with-a-Facebook-social-plug-in?\n        since the Like button is a little piece of Facebook embedded on\n        another website, the browser is sending information about the\n        request to load Facebook content on that page. We record some of\n        this information for a limited amount of time\nTODO: what's that limited amount of time? (see below I assume)\n        when you go to a website with a Like button, we need to know who\n        you are […]  The data we receive includes your user ID, the\n        website you're visiting, the date and time, and other\n        browser-related information. \n        \n        If you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account and visit\n        a website with the Like button or another social plugin, […] We\n        do receive the web page you're visiting, the date and time, and\n        other browser-related information. We record this information\n        for a limited amount of time […] we sometimes find bugs in the\n        systems we’ve built to gather aggregate data on how people are\n        interacting with sites that use the Like button or other social\n        plugins. It’s helpful to be able to reference this anonymized\n        information when investigating these bugs so we can find their\n        source and fix them quickly.\n        \n\"anonymized information\"???? WTH. They have \"browser-related\ninformation\" although they don't have the facebook user id. Is that\nreally anonymity? what's browser-related information? is a cookie\nbrowser-related?\n\nFortunately the last part gives us some guarantee; but I'd be more\nconfident if they were in the terms rather than an help page…\n\n        we do not use the information we receive when you visit a site\n        with the “Like” button or another social plugin to create a\n        profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites or to\n        show you ads, although we may use anonymous or aggregate data to\n        improve ads generally. We delete or anonymize the information we\n        receive within 90 days, and we don't sell it to advertisers or\n        share it without your permission.\n        \nNow. That's an interesting question: they say they \"delete or anonymize\"\nwhich supposes that the information is previously not anonymous -- I\nsuppose that refers to information recorded on users logged-in.\n\nSo as I understand, that means that for information gathered on users\nwho are logged-in, Facebook keeps the information  forever (except the\nuser-id). That information includes \"the web page you're visiting, the\ndate and time, and other browser-related information\".\n\nTODO: facebook states they don't sell or share it unless they have \"your\npermission\". I wonder where that permission comes from: is there a\nprivacy setting somewhere for this? \n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
