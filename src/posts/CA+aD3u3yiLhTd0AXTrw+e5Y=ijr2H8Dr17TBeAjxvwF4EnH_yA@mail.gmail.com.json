  "text": "i just had a look at http://www.mywot.com/en/trustseal and tried\ntyping facebook.com, google.com, mail.ru, thepiratebay.se,\ntwitter.com, unhosted.org, tos-dr.info, wikipedia.org, scam.com into\nit, and all those examples just showed 'trusted' as the result. when i\ntried with 'tosdr.org' (one of our own aliases), it said 'sorry, the\ncommunity is not convinced'. so that doesn't seem to have a lot of\ninformation other than that a site exists and has some traffic? i\nthink there's not much use then in incorporating that information.\n\non the other hand, this: http://privacyparrot.com/popular seems like a\nuseful source that we should add to our data points (while making\nclear in the description that these data points come from\nprivacyparrot).\n\nciao,\nMichiel\n",
