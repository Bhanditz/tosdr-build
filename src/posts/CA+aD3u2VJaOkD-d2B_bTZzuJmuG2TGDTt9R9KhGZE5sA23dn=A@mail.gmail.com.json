  "text": "this seems ok to me, but it's a bit weird that they ask Californians\nto contradict some Californian laws, so i wanted to mention it:\n\n\"4.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event\nthat you have a dispute with one or more members, you release us (and\nour officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates)\nfrom claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every\nkind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,\ndisclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with\nsuch disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California\nCivil Code 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to\nclaims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his\nfavor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must\nhave materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\"\"\n",
