However, we may assign this\n      Agreement to any person at any time without notice.<br>\n      <br>\n      In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions is\n      found invalid or unenforceable pursuant to any judicial decree or\n      decision, such provision shall be deemed to apply only to the\n      maximum extent permitted by law, and the remainder of these Terms\n      and Conditions shall remain valid and enforceable according to its\n      terms.</p>\n    <p> In order to keep the forums growing and to prevent conflicts we\n      have created some rules for the site. These rules were created to\n      help limit the flaming and common disagreements that can occur on\n      public forums. They are also a way to ensure that we do not offend\n      other users.<br>\n      <br>\n      General Rules:<br>\n      <br>\n      1. Attacks - As with any large groups of people there will be\n      disagreements. This is understandable, but we will not tolerate\n      flaming other members. We are all adults and in such should be\n      able to keep our emotions in check. There will not be any\n      personal/insulting attacks or inflammatory posts. You can\n      disagree, but do it politely.<br>\n      <br>\n      2. Language - No dirty language. We are trying to create a place\n      where you don’t have to worry if your child is sitting next to you\n      while reading. Please keep your language clean. The friendly\n      workarounds on using crude language will not be tolerated also. We\n      are not talking about damn, hell, and other small ones, we are\n      talking about the major ones and you know what they are.<br>\n      <br>\n      3. Opposite Sex - We are starting to pick up more female users.\n      These females offer an insight that we “males” cannot offer, so\n      make sure to keep derogatory comments about the opposite sex in\n      check. If you are not willing to say it face to face, don’t think\n      it is ok from behind the keyboard.<br>\n      <br>\n      4. Post Count - You want to up your membership status, please help\n      us out by saying hello to new members. No multiple or repeat\n      postings to get your post count up. <br>\n      <br>\n      5. Advertising – There are many users that want to advertise their\n      products or products of others. If you are not a contributing\n      member to the forum these advertisements will not be tolerated.\n      For those who are promoting products please ensure they are\n      related to the 2nd Amendment.<br>\n      <br>\n      6. Accounts – You are only allowed one account. If your account is\n      suspended or deleted you are not allowed to create another\n      account. If multiple accounts are discovered they will be deleted!<br>\n      <br>\n      7. Content – This site is for the carrying of firearms for\n      personal protection and the protection of the 2nd Amendment. There\n      are many issues out there that can get out of hand real quick.\n      Keep this in mind when opening a thread that does not contain\n      pertinent info to the site’s purpose. We will keep a close eye on\n      threads that run the risk of getting out of hand quickly and will\n      close it down if it starts going bad. Do not create a thread or\n      post about anything illegal such as carrying concealed illegally.\n      Your thread/post will be deleted and you will be warned.<br>\n      <br>\n      8. Photos - Members are allowed and encouraged to post on topic\n      pictures. Please keep your picture appropriate and clean. Photos\n      that are considered inappropriate will be removed and you will be\n      notified of such. If this problem continues you will risk having\n      your account suspended or deleted. This includes your avatar.<br>\n      <br>\n      These are some of the basic rules to govern the forums. We cannot\n      think of everything so we reserve the right to create new rules or\n      contact you on a case by case base. Remember keep it civil and be\n      nice. If things are getting out of hand we will have to jump in\n      and give warnings, close threads, or suspend/delete accounts.<br>\n      <br>\n      Marketplace Rules:erm</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n<p></p>\n\n-- <br />\n[!!] Please see <a href=\"https://edit.tosdr.org\">https://edit.tosdr.org</a> -- this is where new contributions should be submitted and discussed<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr<br />\n--- <br />\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups &quot;Terms of Service; Didn&#39;t Read&quot; group.<br />\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to <a href=\"mailto:tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com\">tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com</a>.<br />\nTo post to this group, send email to <a href=\"mailto:tosdr@googlegroups.com\">tosdr@googlegroups.com</a>.<br />\nVisit this group at <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/group/tosdr\">https://groups.google.com/group/tosdr</a>.<br />\nTo view this discussion on the web visit <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/tosdr/0508bec0-57a7-2f6a-0cef-5cc2493e5169%40gmail.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer\">https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/tosdr/0508bec0-57a7-2f6a-0cef-5cc2493e5169%40gmail.com</a>.<br />\nFor more options, visit <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/optout\">https://groups.google.com/d/optout</a>.<br />\n",
