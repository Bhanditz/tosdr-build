  "text": "as i understand this section:\n\n15.3 If you are (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or\nresident of any country to which the United States has embargoed goods\nor services, (b) identified as a \"Specially Designated National\", or\n(c) placed on the Commerce Departmentâ€™s Denied Persons List, you\nrepresent and warrant that you will not engage in financial\ntransactions with, or commercial activities on, CouchSurfing\n(including making payments in connection with any identity\nverification tools provided by CouchSurfing). Without limiting the\nforegoing, you are solely responsible for determining whether you have\ncomplied with travel restrictions to and from certain countries,\nincluding travel to and from countries other than the U.S.\n\nand this information about the US embargo against Cuba:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba\n\nit would be illegal to use CouchSurfing if you hold a Cuban passport.\nis that true? Please correct me if i'm wrong in interpreting this\nclause, but that's what it looks like to me.\n\nnow, regardless of which country we're all from and what our\ngovernments agree or disagree on with each other, it would be nice if\ni could use CouchSurfing just because i'm a human being, and not\nbecause of my nationality.\n\nI understand that this is a result of them being only located in the\nUS, and i know for instance Dropbox has the same problem, but for\ninstance Facebook has offices in the US and in Ireland, meaning all\nhumans can use it, regardless of nationality.\n\nCurious what other people think of this. :)\n",
