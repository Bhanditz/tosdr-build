Clearly indicating the\ninevitability  that the digital tracking will creep into the physical\nspaces. It is no surprise the Facebook is pushing this envelope.\n\nA quote from the article \"Datalogix (a data matching company) gets its\ninformation from retailers like grocery stores and drug stores who\nkeep careful records of what its customers who use its loyalty\ndiscount programs are buying.\"\n\nThen, with the Facebook partnership, Datalogix is able to match your\nFacebook profile with drug store purchases..\n\nHere is the article.\n\nhttp://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/09/facebook-tracking-you-drug-store-now-too/57183/\n\nI think it is critically important that informed consent is acquired\nat the point of purchase (in the physical world) to share this\ninformation with a third party like Facebook.  This informed consent\nrequirement is extremely important especially for physical world\nintegration of digital information.  Perhaps this is something as a\ngroup we could advocate?\n\nBest Regards\n\n- Mark\n\n--\nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google\nGroups \"open notice\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to opennotice@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to\nopennotice+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n",
