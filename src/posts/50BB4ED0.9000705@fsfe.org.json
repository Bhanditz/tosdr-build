  "subject": "Spotify end user agreement and privacy policy review",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI read you’d rather have a topic per point, but considering I read both\nSpotify’s end user agreement and privacy policy, in their French\nversion, it would make many many topics. I prefer sending the list,\nprefixed by [GOOD] and [BAD] when I could figure it out. Each point is\nlinked to the paragraph of EUA or PP to be easily sourced.\n\nI hope somebody will be able to get it online.\n\n----- From End-User Agreement (EUA) -----\nhttps://www.spotify.com/fr/legal/end-user-agreement/ as of 2012-12-02.\n\n* [BAD] EUA is only available in the language of the country from which\nyou connect. Trying to access the english version forwards back to the\nFrench’s in my case.\n\n* [BAD] They protect themselves from anything whatsoever, putting the\nfull responsibility on the end user without explaining what the hell the\nend user is supposed to respect. For instance, in EUA §11, they simply\nsay to respect everything related to USA export acts.\n\n* [BAD] I suspect some terms to be illegal in France, which is handled\nby the EUA saying here and there: this term will be applicable in the\nextent of applicable law. It results in the inability for the end user\nto know what they can expect if they don’t know what their law allows\nand forbids.\n\n* [BAD] If they change the price of the subscription, they warn you, but\nthey state no delay. So, if they change the day before your renewal,\nyou’ll be charged the new price. (EUA §12-3)\n\n* [GOOD] You can unsubscribe from the web page (EUA §12)\n\n* [BAD] You will never be refunded (EUA §13) and if you have any problem\nwhatsoever, uninstall the software is your only possible action (EUA\n§15). I deduce you should never subscribe for more than a month.\n\n* [BAD] There is no guarantee of quality of service. Should the service\nnot be delivered, you still pay. In the extent of applicable law.\n\n* [BAD] Your data are accessible to trading parties (EUA §7). Nature of\nsuch data isn’t defined in EUA.\n\n* Special offers, community access to customer service may use different\nagreements (EUA §16). Such agreements cannot contradict this EUA. It\nmeans you should always keep an eye on them, but I can’t decide whether\nit’s good or bad.\n\n* [BAD] You grant perpetual license to use anything you publish. While\nthe global license expires when you unsubscribe, public content will\nremain licensed and will not be deleted (EUA §6-1). If law permits, you\nrenounce to requiring your content to be deleted.\n\n* [BAD] They can close your account without notice, without refund and\nwithout reason (EUA §6).\n\nAn end-user will easily find and understand the main point of the\naggreement: they can do whatever they want, you pay and shut up. There\nis no summary at the top of agreements.\n\n\n\n----- From Privacy Policy (PP) -----\nhttps://www.spotify.com/fr/legal/privacy-policy/ as of 2012-12-02.\n\n* [GOOD] Personal data is described in PP §2. If you connect from\nFacebook, they’ll get many more data.\n\n* [BAD] PP §2.2 about “transactional information allowing the management\nof digital rights” in imprecise and allows for everything to be\ncollected until a court judges is shouldn’t have been. French version: «\ninformations transactionnelles permettant la gestion des droits\nnumériques ».\n\n* [BAD] PP §2.4 states that billing is processed by external company.\nWithout knowing who, impossible to know what data they’ll keep.\n\n* [GOOD] PP §2.4 states that billing companies only sends limited\ninformation to Spotify.\n\n* PP §2.6 about special events says addition data will be merged into\nyour profile for later reuse.\n\n* PP §3 defines intended use of your personal information. Too long to\nreproduce here.\n\n* They make extended use of social networks to promote the service (PP\n§4). It can be disabled (not explained how). They’ll keep the token to\naccess your FB account anytime.\n\n* [GOOD] They warn about the use third party application may do of your\npersonal data if you permit it (PP §4.3). They’ll do their best to make\nthem unable to identify you, unless you allow it.\n\n* [BAD] They may need external companies to get the outmost of your\npersonal data, in which case they would apply undefined confidentiality\npolicies. PP §4.4 is weak (incomplete and imprecise).\n\n* [BAD] They don’t plan to inform you if they need to give your personal\ninformation to court (PP §4.5)\n\n* [GOOD] PP §5 insists on the risks of having public information.\n\n* [FEAR] They may transfer your data outside of EU. You “expressly\naccept this term”. The way PP §6 is written is quite fearful. It is not\nsaid if they will comply with law, as personal data cannot moved out of\nEU without it being allowed by EU or with drastic protection protocol in\nthe case of France.\n\n* They do not ensure data security. While the term 8 starts in a good\nway: they commit to protect data, it ends with: we don’t guarantee we’ll\nsucceed. Well, it’s a reality, so is it bad or good to state it? I’d say\nit’s good, but the shortness of the term doesn’t state they really want\nto protect data.\n\n* [GOOD] PP changes are notified though the service.\n\n\n\n",
