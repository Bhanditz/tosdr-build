  "text": "http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/if-twitpics-new-deal-troubles-you-here-are-some-other-options/\n\nThis is one year old. Since then, Twitter now has the same kind of terms\nthan Twitpic, and Twitter now hosts pictures themselves. As stated in\ntwitter.com/tos pictures are part of the \"Content\" subject to the broad\ncopyright license.\n\n\nMay 26, 2011, 6:32 pm\nIf Twitpicâ€™s New Deal Troubles You, Here Are Some Options\nBy PAUL BOUTIN\n\nWord got out this week that Twitpic, the most popular service used by\nTwitter users to upload and post photos, had struck an exclusive\npartnership with World Entertainment News Network, a news and photo\nagency that specializes in celebrity stories and pictures.\n\nThe deal allows the agency to sell images posted on Twitpic for\npublication elsewhere. (Flickr, by contrast, expressly forbids the reuse\nof its members' photos without their personal permission or a special\ncopyright designation that allows commercial use.)\n\nTwitter users went ballistic, especially professional photographers,\nbecause the deal effectively turned Twitpic's 20 million registered\nusers into a free photo pool from which someone else could potentially\nmake money for hot shots like Janis Krums' 2009 picture of Flight 1549\nlanding on the Hudson River, or Stefanie Gordon's recent photo (shown)\ntaken from her airplane seat, of the space shuttle Endeavor lifting off\nthrough the clouds. Ms. Gordon told MSNBC that five news agencies had\npaid her for use of her photo, which has been seen by millions, but many\nmore publishers had not.\n\nWorld Entertainment News Network's chief executive said he was only\ninterested in photos posted by celebrity Twitter users, which is\nW.E.N.N.'s specialty. But a brief statement from Twitpic dodged the\nW.E.N.N. issue, stating only that Twitpic would clamp down on\nunauthorized use of members' photos. \"You allow us to distribute that\ncontent on twitpic.com and our affiliated partners,\" the post reminded\nusers.\n\nTo be fair, your text messages are equally republishable by Twitter, as\nstated in that company's nearly identical legalese. But some people feel\ndifferently about their pictures.\n\nThe opportunity to have a hastily snapped photo become world-famous is\nmore appealing to many Twitter users than the need to get paid for it,\nor to control its publication. But if Twitpic's terms of service bug\nyou, there's a quick fix: Change the settings on your Twitter mobile app\nto switch the photo upload service from Twitpic to yfrog, the other\nbuilt-in option.\n\nThe terms of service of Yfrog, which is made by ImageShack, are pretty\nblunt: \"ImageShack will not sell or distribute your content to third\nparties or affiliates without your permission. Third parties may\nhyperlink to the page that displays your content on the ImageShack\nNetwork without modification and with proper attribution to you. Third\nparties may request permission to use your content by contacting you\ndirectly. All requests for permission regarding your content usage\ndirected at ImageShack will be forwarded to you.\" So it seems unlikely\nthat pictures uploaded to yfrog will end up in, say, a TMZ story without\nyou getting a shot at royalties.\n\nShould you delete your photos from Twitpic? Take a cue from the talk\nshow host Ellen Degeneres. In response to W.E.N.N.'s deal with Twitpic,\nshe stopped using Twitpic in her Twitter messages a couple of weeks ago.\nShe now posts photos to her own ellen.tv site. But she hasn't bothered\nto go back and move all of her old pictures off of Twitpic. That makes\nsense, because it's unlikely that World Entertainment News Network will\ngo data-mining Twitpic archives for old photos. What they want are the\nlatest snapshots of what's happening and who's hot right now, for which\nTwitter is the best medium ever. That picture of the space shuttle? So\nlast week.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
