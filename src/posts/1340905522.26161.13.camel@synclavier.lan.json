We will provide you\n        with notice of the transfer of your Personal Information to the\n        new entity. \"\n        \n\nSo it's fairly common to consider private and personal information as\nbusiness assets, transferable.\n\nONOH, depending on the level of protection for the user that the privacy\npolicy provides (e.g. about where the data is stored and processed) I\ndon't think it really matters which company is doing it--the terms are\nbinding on them too (unless they are changed, but that can also happen\nregardless of the business transfer).\n\nOTOH, not having any of the personal/private data transferable could\nmake the company impossible to sell (because the company acquiring the\nservice would not be able to operate the service in full continuity,\nwhich is causing a lot of disagreement.)\n\nSo in the end, unless we see surprising things in there, I have the\nimpression that we shouldn't really focus on this, as it seems more or\nless irrelevant and accessory to the real issues.\n\nDoes anyone have a dissenting opinion? If not, I will also bring the\ndata point from Delicious about this to 0.\n        \n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
