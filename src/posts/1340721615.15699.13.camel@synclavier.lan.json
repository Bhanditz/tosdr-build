  "subject": "Facebook's tracking \"Like\" buttons, to become even more pervasive with OpenGraph API",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI just read that Facebook's released a new kind of social plugin. Unlike\ntheir \"Like\" button and social applets, developers using Facebook's Open\nGraph API can also track users directly through Facebook.\n\nI need to investigate a bit more, but here's an article from TechChrunch\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/facebooks-hidden-like-isnt-just-good-for-mobile-developers-its-good-for-facebook/\n\nOnce you skip all the buzzwords and the future anticipation platitude,\nthere are interesting facts.\n\n        But the Facebook “like,” still relatively new in the grand\n        scheme of things, has already become synonymous with “market to\n        me in my News Feed.” The decision to press the seemingly\n        innocuous thumbs up now holds a meaning that even less technical\n        folks have come to understand. It’s the modern equivalent of\n        “add my name to your email distribution list.” (So far we’ve\n        come, so little has changed.)\n        \n        That’s why the “hidden” like is so interesting. It’s integrated\n        seamlessly into the application. You’re not “liking” a Facebook\n        Page, you’re “liking” an Instagram photo. And it’s not a thumbs\n        up icon – it’s a little heart…or whatever else the developer\n        sees fit to use. The point being: it looks like part of the app\n        itself. It will become impossible to tell (without reading all\n        the pop-up disclaimers and EULAs – and who does?) which in-app\n        actions will live within the app and which populate Facebook.\n        And that’s the idea. That’s how they getcha.\n        \n        …\n        \n        In a (not-so-distant?) future, you can see where this is headed,\n        in terms of advertising. A user “likes” Instagram photos of\n        beaches and sunsets. The user then sees ads for vacations and\n        cruises on Facebook. A user “likes” a friend’s Starbucks\n        check-in in Foursquare, but has never “liked” Starbucks’ fan\n        page on Facebook. Now Starbucks knows to show them ads and\n        deals. It’s the re-creation of the tracking cookie’s\n        capabilities in a “web” where people surf mobile applications,\n        not websites. And what could it become? The possibilities are\n        mind-boggling. You “like” photos of beaches, you launch a travel\n        app to book plane tickets for a work trip and find Caribbean\n        vacation packages are now on sale. Coincidence, or “like”\n        tracking? You may not know, but what’s even better, is that you\n        may not care.\n        \nI assume these things will start to popup in mobile apps terms, as well\nas web apps.  If anyone's got an idea or want to dive in this detail\nfrom Instagram e.g. feel free!\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
