  "text": "So we have an ambivalent case. The copyright license can be both good\nand bad here, depending on the type of content that's licensed.\n\nhttp://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html\n        Section 9 CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON\n        THE YAHOO! SERVICES\n        \n        Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make\n        available for inclusion on the Yahoo! Services. However, with\n        respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on\n        publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services, you grant\n        Yahoo! the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive\n        license(s), as applicable:\n        \nDefinition of \"publicly accessible\" follows.\n\nThis part is only about Yahoo! Groups. (We should create a thread\nspecific to yahoo groups maybe.)\n        \n            With respect to Content you submit or make available for\n        inclusion on publicly accessible areas of Yahoo! Groups, the\n        license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly\n        perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services\n        solely for the purposes of providing and promoting the specific\n        Yahoo! Group to which such Content was submitted or made\n        available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to\n        continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will\n        terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content\n        from the Yahoo! Services.\n        \nThe copyright license is limited for the purpose of the service (and\ndoesn't include rights to transfer+sublicense) and terminates when the\nuser removes the content.\n\nFor photos and graphics (Flickr)  audio or video, it's pretty much the\nsame:\n\n            With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit\n        or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of\n        the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to\n        use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and\n        publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services solely for\n        the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made\n        available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to\n        continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will\n        terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content\n        from the Yahoo! Services.\n        \nBut for anything that's not photos, graphics, audio or video, it's not\nreally good:\n\n            With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio\n        or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly\n        accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo!\n        Groups, __the perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable\n        license__ to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,\n        translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content\n        (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other\n        works in any format or medium now known or later developed.\n        \nI don't really know what to make of that. Which services other than\nYahoo Groups deal with this kind of content? \n\n        \"Publicly accessible\" areas of the Yahoo! Services are those\n        areas of the Yahoo! network of properties that are intended by\n        Yahoo! to be available to the general public. By way of example,\n        publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services would include\n        Yahoo! Message Boards and portions of Yahoo! Groups and Flickr\n        that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly\n        accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services would not include\n        portions of Yahoo! Groups that are limited to members, Yahoo!\n        services intended for private communication such as Yahoo! Mail\n        or Yahoo! Messenger, or areas off of the Yahoo! network of\n        properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are\n        accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or\n        served by Yahoo!.\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
