But it is possible that I overestimated some of these\nclauses so farâ€¦ Are they really needed?\n\nLet's have an hypothetical case, where someone uploads a remix on\nsoundcloud. That remix contains a sample of a song by Frank Zappa. Then,\nGail Zappa of the \"Zappa Family Trust\" hears about the song, gets upset\nand sends a DMCA-style notice to Soundcloud.\n\nFirst thing: it's not obvious that the remix is copyright infringement.\nLet's say the sample is very brief and does not seem to qualify for\n\"originality.\"\n\nSecond thing: what will Soundcloud do? At this time, it's in their hands\nto be prompt at removing alleged infringing material. If they fail to\ncomply with the law (DMCA, or ecommerce or whatever similar law applies\nin our case) why should I indemnify them? All I did is upload a remix\nwhich I thought, in good faith, was totally ok under copyright law.\n\nThird thing: if it is my content, then I can still be sued by Zappa, or\nSoundcloud (for breaching their terms). I would prefer to have\neverything dealt with by a judge under copyright/contract law, than to\nhave everything handled from a contractual obligation raised from a\nlawsuit between Soundcloud and some copyright holder.\n\nIn the end, not having these broad indemnification clauses does not seem\nto close any opportunity for soundcloud to get back at their users if\nsomething goes wrong. So they don't seem necessary for me, although they\ndo create some non-negligible risks.\n\nWhat do others think?\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups Terms of Service; Didn't Read group.
