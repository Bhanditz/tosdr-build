  "text": "hi,\n\nThis message is mainly for Hugo, but you're invited to read along if\nyou're interested in our website operations:\n\ni added a node script 'render.js' that generates the full index.html\ninto static html. hopefully it helps to fix some of the browser\nproblems and endless spinners that people have been having.\n\nit takes index-prefix.html and index-suffix.html and puts the services\nlist and the popup elements in the middle. it writes its output to\nindex-gen.html and currently takes its services list from\nindex/services2.json\n\nHugo, please see if index-gen.html looks OK to you and then you can\ncopy it to index.html so that it's what people see when they visit the\nsite. do note that now each time after you run 'node buildIndexes.js'\nyou have to run 'node render.js' to make the new data visible in the\npre-generated page.\n\nAlso, if you want to make html changes to the index page, you'll have\nto do them in index-prefix.html or index-suffix.html as appropriate.\n\n\nHTH,\nMichiel\n",
