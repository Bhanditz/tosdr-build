  "text": "Hello,\n\nObviously one of the most important issues that's addressed in ToS is\nthe copyright license. Not all services are equal in this regard,\nespecially between services where the user operate in private and\nservices where the user shares / publishes content with other people /\nwith the world.\n\n        With this first topic, I'd like to gather some comparative\n        information and discuss what seems to be a fair balance between\n        needs to operate the service and rights of the authors & the\n        public. Then we could try to categorize them and give them a\n        rating.\n\nThe first thing to discuss obviously is the scope of the copyright\nlicense. Some of the ToS out there seems to go as far as they can get in\nscope. It seems to me that the biggest difference are:\n      * some ToS don't grant a specifically large license to the\n        operator of the service but fall back on a copyright public\n        license e.g. creative commons \n      * some ToS require the ability to transfer, sublicense with others\n        (sometimes it is limited to the partners e.g. Twitter Partners)\n\nDo I miss anything substantial?\n\nFacebook:\n        you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable,\n        royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you\n        post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).\n\nTwitter:\n        By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the\n        Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free\n        license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce,\n        process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and\n        distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution\n        methods (now known or later developed).\n        \n        You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to\n        provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content\n        submitted to or through the Services available to other\n        companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter\n        for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of\n        such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms\n        and conditions for such Content use.\n        \nIdenti.ca:\n        By submitting Content to Operator for inclusion on your Website,\n        you grant all readers the right to use, re-use, modify and/or\n        re-distribute the Content under the terms of the Creative\n        Commons Attribution 3.0.\n        \nSeenThis:\n        en publiant leurs messages sur Seenthis, les auteurs acceptent :\n        — que ces messages soient publiés (présentés au public) sur le\n        site seenthis.net,\n        — que ces messages soient organisés et enrichis par les\n        automatismes présents dans le système Seenthis (traduction,\n        thématisation...).\n        \n        By publishing their messages on Seenthis, the authors agree\n        that:\n         - these messages are published (displayed to the public) on the\n        seenthis.net website\n         - these messages are organised and augmented by automatic\n        systems in Seenthis (translation, taggin...).\n        \nNote that SeenThis gives the option when the message is posted to choose\nwhich license (classic copyright, cc-by-sa, and others)\n\nWordpress.com\n        By submitting Content to Automattic for inclusion on your\n        Website, you grant Automattic a world-wide, royalty-free, and\n        non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish\n        the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing\n        and promoting your blog. \n\n-- \nHugo Roy \n  French Coordinator, FSFE       chat: hugo@jabber.fsfe.org\n  www.fsfe.org/about/roy         mobile: +336 08 74 13 41\n                                 mobile DE: +49 151 143 56 563\n\n-- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nFor more options, visit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\n\n",
