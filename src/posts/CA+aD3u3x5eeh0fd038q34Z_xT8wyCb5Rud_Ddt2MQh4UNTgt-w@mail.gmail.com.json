Even if you just donate 5 euros, it doesn't\nmatter. We need some visible engagement from all of you, to make a\nconvincing campaign start.\n\nWhen people see that some donations were made on the first campaign\nday, they will be more confident to follow suit. Let's do it!\n\n\nMany thanks!!\nMichiel.\n",
