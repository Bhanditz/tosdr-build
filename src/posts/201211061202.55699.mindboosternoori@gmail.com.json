  "text": "Hi there,\n\nI've just knew about TOS;DR via FSFE's newsletter, and I have to say to you: \nthanks for existing! \n\nI'm an (unfortunately unusual) reader of TOS's, frequently contacting the \nowners of the services asking them to change this or that bit, and explaining \nto them why I don't feel safe signing their TOS's with those clauses.\n\nOne thing that jumped to my attention on your website is that you classify \nsome things as \"red cross\" while others are just \"thumbs down\". While I agree \nwith that distinction, I would like to discuss with you what makes you choose \nbetween a \"thumbs down\" and a \"red cross\" for a certain type of clause in a \nTOS. \n\nOne particular clause, unfortunately frequent, in TOS's is \"Terms may be \nchanged any time at their discretion, without notice to the user\". You seem to \nclassify that as \"thumbs down\", and this mail is my attempt to convince you \nthat it should be a \"red cross\". Accepting such a clause - at least some \nwordings of it, when it states something like \"you're bound to the latest \nversion of the TOS of this service\" - means you're in fact signing a blank \ncontract: a contract where the other part - the service - can write whatever \nit wants *after* you sign, and you're bound to it. *That* should be a red \ncross: at any time the service can change the complete terms of services to \n\"red crosses items\", and you've accepting it without knowing... \n\nA practical example: Yahoo! doesn't have any red crosses, but it has a \"Terms \nmay be changed any time at their discretion, without notice to the user\" item. \nWhich in practical terms means that tomorrow, their terms can be something \nlike:\n* All your content is (c) Yahoo!\n* We won't inform Government requests\n* We can suspend your account whenever we want for whatever reason we want, \n  without any kind of explanation\n* No pseudonyms allowed\n* You cannot delete your account\n* Deleted content isn't really deleted\n\nOr, in other words, that clause only implies you're automaticly and without \nknowing signing - possibly, if that's the service's will - an \"all red \ncrosses\" Class E TOS...\n\nDo you agree?\n\nBest regards,\n-- \nMarcos Marado\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/didnotread\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
