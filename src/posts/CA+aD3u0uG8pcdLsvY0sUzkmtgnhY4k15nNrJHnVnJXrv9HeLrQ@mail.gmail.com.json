  "text": "Good question! Forwarding it to the \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\"\nmailing list.\n\nIn this case, assuming you \"ticked the box\" that you have read and\nagree with the current developer agreement, you have (maybe without\nknowing it or without wanting to do so) agreed the following with\nthem:\n\n\"If you have any questions or concerns regarding a removal, you may\ncontact us at http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/.\nGoogle reserves the right to suspend or bar any Product from the Web\nStore at its sole discretion.\"\n\nSo you had a right to send that message to the chromium-apps list, but\nthey did not agree to reply to your question, and the removal is at\ntheir sole discretion. I could not find any passage in the developer\nagreement that stated anything like 'we will do our best to inform you\nabout our reasons' or 'we will only block your app if there is\nsomething wrong with it' (they mention the points a-h which may\ntrigger a downtake, but nothing about informing you, and also directly\nafter giving this list of points, they state that it's at their sole\ndiscretion anyway).\n\nas far as i can tell, you have no right to appeal, or even to ever\nfind out why this decision was taken. Anybody else know anything about\nthat? The current developer agreement is here:\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms\n\nThey may of course still reply to your question, it's only been a week\nso far. Let's wait and see...\n\nin the meantime i will see if i can find the corresponding passages\nfor alternative app publishing stores. like for instance the Mozilla\none (launching Q1 of 2013, i think), and there are a few others.\n\nciao!\nMichiel\n\n\nOn Thu, Sep 6, 2012 at 10:13 AM, Colin McDermott\n<colin.m.mcdermott@gmail.com> wrote:\n> Hi,\n>\n> Just a few minutes ago I got an email out of the blue that Google is\n> removing my Chrome web app from the app store because \"did not comply with\n> our\n> policies on spam\".\n>\n> First of all I absolutely object to my app being called spam - it had 8000+\n> weekly users who would disagree with that I am sure!
