  "text": "In general I thought they were pretty fair - you can read them here http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_13819201_cou?nodeId=508088\n\nA few things that caught my eye - \n\nRight off the bat - \"If you visit or shop at Amazon.com, you accept these conditions.\"  This is something that is weak from a legal standpoint.  Amazon does not require you to acknowledge terms when you view or visit the site.  What would make this hold up is if there was a very visible notice or a acknowledgement indicating that you agreed.  It's like asking about a raffle and then being required to enter it simply by asking about it.  It's almost a nonsensical stipulation.  This is exactly why legitimate parking lots have \"we will tow you\" signs posted at the entrance of their lots.\n\nAs you read the rest of this - remember that you have already agreed to this by virtue of visiting Amazon's website.\n       \n\"you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian.\"  This is a somewhat contradictory clause.  If your kid makes a purchase on Amazon (without your consent), he or she is entering into a contract with Amazon, which is immediately void because the contract is with a minor. Amazon is saying that you would be responsible, but that they cannot sell products to kids without their parents permission.  Clear as mud?\n\n\"We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\"  That is, no one (not even a lawyer on your behalf) can bring a class action lawsuit against Amazon.  You must use an arbitrator - one selected by Amazon.    \n\nI have a few more - including the use of any customer's name that may raise some eyebrows.  \n\nHowever, overall nothing seems to be too out of line.  But I suppose that's up to the reader.\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/Unhosted/ToS-DR\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
