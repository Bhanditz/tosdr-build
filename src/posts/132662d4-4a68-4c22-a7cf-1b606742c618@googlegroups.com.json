Terms call into one of these components.\n \n\n   - *Permissions*: Terms that state how you can use the software or \n   service are grouped as permissions.  This could include permission to use \n   the software or services for personal use only.  Permissions could lso \n   include opt-in or opt-out clauses and the right to uninstall.\n   - *Requirements*: When using the software or service you may need to \n   meet certain requirements.  For example, you may need to be 18+ or you may \n   only use the software or service in a particular location.  You may even be \n   required to accept terms in a separate agreement (i.e. for third-party \n   software or service).\n   - *Restrictions*: When using the software you may be prohibited from \n   doing doing certain things such as copying, reverse-engineering, making \n   derrivative works. using third-party software/services/hardware or other \n   actions.\n   - *Functions*: When using the software or you may need to acknowledge or \n   be aware of how it behaves.
